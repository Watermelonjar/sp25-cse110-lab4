Some JavaScript developers believe that most of the issues with JavaScript stem from its asynchronous nature, its loose typing, and the web platform it runs on. For each of the three reasons listed, explain in your own words why a developer might believe that it is a pain point.
1. well for one, the asynchronous nature makes it so that it is harder to debug, since it kinda disrupts the linear flow that most developers are used to. Loose typing while in some cases would make a program run better than it supposed to, will show a lot of bugs that could be confused because of unclear typing. The web platform for each flavor/system could have a different set of rules/ version, hence it is hard to make consistent code.


Related to the first question, why do you believe that the developer(s) who created JavaScript made it loosely typed? Why do you think they added asynchronous features?
2. loosely type makes it easier for begginer, you don't really need to know the type of variables to start with. They added asynchronouse feature because most of its duty is over the network, which needs a lot of asynchronous code to keep a web responsive.

What are the key differences between a compiled language and an interpreted one? Which one is JavaScript? What are the benefits & drawbacks of JavaScript being made that way?
3. compiled language are compiled/translated to machine code when you compile them, which could take some time to compile, however the result is really fast. Interpreted language are executed at runtime which is easier to run, however it is shlower. Javascript is interpreted language, 
benefits:
- Easier testing and feedback
- could help begginers since syntax is usually easier 
Cons:
- slow
- optimization is hard, also debugging is even harder

The professor believes that, though sometimes misused, JavaScript frameworks are incredibly powerful tools that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. Given that, why do you believe he is focusing more on vanilla JavaScript for this course? What are the benefits of mastering vanilla JS first? What are the drawbacks of not learning a framework?
4. Because if you understand core JS, you will understand most libraries if you learn it for a bit. Core JS gives the way on how DOM works how events are handled and async code. Benefits would be that you will know how a website trully works in base form, and you can learn other frameworks faster. However it is almost impossible to learn large-scale apps with just vanilla JS, you also lose on industry level tools.

Explain, in your own words, how you think this lab relates to your project. How might you be able to use this information in your own project?
5. This lab helps me with a lot of JS concept such as loose typing and asynchronous timing. I think the most important tool was the devtool section where a lot of ideas are expanded for debugging JS code.
